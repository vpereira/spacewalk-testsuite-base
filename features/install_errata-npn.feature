  Scenario: Install an erratum to the client
    Given I am on the Systems overview page of this client
     And I follow "Software" in class "content-nav"
     And I follow "Errata" in class "contentnav-row2"
    When I check "TestsuiteRepo" in the list
     And I wait for "2" seconds
     And I click on "Apply Errata"
     And I wait for "2" seconds
     And I click on "Confirm"
     And I wait for "5" seconds
     And I run rhn_check on this client
    Then I should see a "1 errata update has been scheduled for" text
     And "sles-release-11.3-99.1" is installed
